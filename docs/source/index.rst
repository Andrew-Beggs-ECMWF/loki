   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Loki's documentation!
================================

.. todo:: This mostly lists all modules/subpackages at the moment, some of it
          is also redundant to hand-crafted documentation in other places.
          This should be filled further as we go along.
