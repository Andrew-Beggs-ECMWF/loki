   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Loki's documentation!
================================

.. important::
    Loki is still under active development and has not yet seen a stable
    release. Interfaces can change at any time, objects may be renamed, or
    concepts may be re-thought. Make sure to sync your work to the current
    `master` frequently by rebasing feature branches and upstreaming
    more general applicable work in the form of pull requests.

.. todo:: This mostly lists all modules/subpackages at the moment, some of it
          is also redundant to hand-crafted documentation in other places.
          This should be filled further as we go along.
